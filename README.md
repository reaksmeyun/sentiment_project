# HappySad AI 🟢

## 📌 Project Description
**HappySad AI** is a sentiment analysis project that analyzes social media posts (tweets) to classify sentiment as **positive** or **negative**.  

It implements the following models:  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, LinearSVC  
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM  

The project has two main parts: **AI models** and **Web interface**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Sentiment140 dataset (~1.6 million tweets)  
- **Source:** [Kaggle / Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- Rename file of dataset that downloaded to "semtiment140_analysis_dataset.csv"
- **Columns:** sentiment, id, date, query, user, text  

**Sentiment mapping:**  
- `0` → negative  
- `4` → positive  

Emoji handling is done using `emoji.demojize()` so the model can understand emojis.
